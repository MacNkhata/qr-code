## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The main purpose of taking on this project was to act as a refresher an enhance my skills in the foundations of web development which is html and CSS.

I practiced:

- Creating class names: This might seem as a simple task to some but it is one the headaches as it is hard sometimes to find descriptive class names.
- Flexbox: I had a refresher course on flexbox and its wonders. I applied some concepts in this project to see where my understanding is and how I can apply the concepts in different scenarios.
- CSS Variables: This is a concept that I have been trying to grasp for a long time and finally I have the chance to read and practice.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me with the CSS variables. It contains the documentation for CSS and html with easy easy to understand examples.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Here I followed examples on how to make my image take the border radius of its parent.
